the
transport
delivery
off

was

to

on

minimum
purchase
from

originally
this
transport
imbalance
was
to
be
cleared
the
next
month
in

some
of
the
imbalance
was
cleared
in
may
of
1999
but
91
297
mmbtu
still
remains
as
a
imbalance
on
this
contract
we
need
to
monitor
the
ifhsc
index
for
the
upcoming
months
so
that
when
one
is
compatible
with
the
ifhsc
index
of
april
of
1999
we
can
clear
this
imbalance
we
will
need
to
allocated
91
297
mmbtu
extra
to
the
transport
this
will
reduce
the
purchase
from
ena
by
91
297
mmbtu
for
that
month
i
need

to
watch

first
some
background
we
feed
beaumont
methanol
through
a

station
that
we
own
and
control
but
which
also
feeds
brandywine

in

the
gas
goes
through
a
dupont
pipeline
header
downstream
of
our

station
before
it
gets
to
beamont
methanol
sometimes
we
are
doing

with
both
beaumont

hey
guys
just
wanted
to
make
known
my
concerns
on
this
issue
while
i
agree
that
howard
robert
and
george
needed
to
work
on
this
together
i
do
not
think
that
howard
should
have
been
the
driving
force
behind
this
once
we
left
the
meeting
they
all
convened
on
the
37
th
floor
and
worked
from
howard
'
s
desk
with
howard
sitting
down
doing
much
of
the
work
i
also
think
that
the
below
e
mail
should
not
have
come
from
howard
but
should
have
originated
out
of
the
logistics
group
i
understand
that
howard
has
prior
scheduling
experience
but
he
is
not
functioning
in
a
scheduling
role
now
and
bascially
took
on
that
role
in
getting
this
set
up
correctly
he
too
had
to
sit
down
and
try
to
figure
out
what
needed
to
be
done
and
set
everything
up
correctly
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
kudoo
for
howard
for
stepping
up
but
i
am
concerned
at
the
role
that
he
played
team
effort
is
important
and
it
'
s
what
we
all
want
between
our
groups
but
i
want
to
ensure
that
everyone
does
their
fair
share
and
expectations
are
appropriately
placed
let
me
know
what
you
both
think

i

the

currently
unify
is
adding

pricing
the
first
10

at

price
and
anything
over

at

for

may

on

may

unify
currently
prices
the
first
10
000
at
a
certain
price
and
5000
at
a

price
this
is
incorrect
because
none
of
the
meters
exceeded
10

each
meter
should
be
priced
at
the
first
tier
level
robert

one
additional

he
will
not

anita

will
move
the
volumes
to
the
correct
ticket
when
she
allocates
the
volumes
each

equistar
receives
manual
invoices
each
month
because
they
need
to
see
the
sale
and
the
buyback
on
the
same
invoice
and
they
also
need

have

at

i

'

for

as
many
of
you
may
already
know
i
am
an
insulin
dependent
diabetic
myself
even
though
i
know
how
difficult
this
disease
can
be
to
manage
with
the
multiple
finger
pricks
for
blood
samples
and
several
shots
each
day
i
cannot
imagine
how
difficult
it
is
for
a
small
child
with
this
disease
taking
insulin
does
not
cure
the
disease
nor
prevent
the
development
of
complications
insulin
is
simply
their
life
support
system
and
without
it
they
would
die
enron
continues
to
be
a
major
corporate
sponsor
for
jdf
again
this

jdf
is
a
very
efficient
organization

approximately
84

we

this

is
knock
out
diabetes
and
we
would
like
to
have
you
join
us
for

event
the

a
blast

500
enron

participate
last

everyone
enjoyed
it

everyone
is

unfortunately
many
of
you
are
new

did
not

to

what
your

'
s

is
i
have
the

salary
for

of

i

to
also
give
me
the
low

the
high
let
'
s
face
it
your

today
and
their

most
likely
are
not
what
they
are
going
to
be
next
year
to
much
movement
of
people
so
using
estimates
and

will
probably
be
as
accurate
as
using
current

levels
here
'
s
what
you
can
do
1
make
a
list
of
your

just
their

then
put

if

etc
you
can
guess
at
this
based
on
their

length

in

position
etc

the
first
issue
is
day
1
of
the
purchase
at
fuels
cotton
we
have
two
deals
in
sitara
spot
deal
348951
and
exchange
deal
157288
you
had
said
previously
that
we
would
know
a
spot
deal
had
occurred
by
the
new
deal
ticket
and
the
different
pricing
since
there
was
a
spot
deal
we
put
all
of
the
volume
for
day
1
on
deal
348951
duke
says
that
day
1
was
not
a
spot
and
that
it
should
be
on
the
exchange
deal
and
priced
at
gd
0
10
the
exchange
deal
is
currently
price
at
index
0
05
please
let
me
know
which
deal
we
are
suppose
to
use
and
what
the
price
should
be
the
second
issue
is
the
sale
volume
on
deal
157278
for
8
00
duke
is
telling
me
that
we
sold
them
a
batch
of
gas
on
the
7
th
which
we
see
but
that
we
are
suppose
to
prorate
the
gas
over
the
5
th
6
th
and
7
th
for
the
exchange
this
is
a
problem
since
gas
was
not
confirmed
for
the
5
th
and
6
th
and
pipeline
shows
all
of
the
gas
on
the
7
th
this
is
a
daily
swing
meter
which
electronically
feeds
into
settlements
we
don
'
t
normally
change
these
meters
if
you
intended
for
us
to
prorate
this
gas
i
will
need
your

i
understand
that
they
terminated
their

however
i
don

t
feel

we
can
confiscate
their

we
need
to
either
pay
them
for
the
gas
or
cut
a
deal
to
redeliver
a
like
volume
to
them
at
another

given
the
decrease

from

they
want
to
be
paid
we

i

find

that
compares
hot

from

there
are
two

one
tab
contains
the

and
the
other
tab
contains
the

each
tab
contains
both
the
load

and
temp
data
particular
to
the

in
question
the
days
most
directly
comparable
are
may
17
2001
thursday
and
may
18
2000
thursday
although
the
two
days
preceding
may
18
2000
were
slightly
warmer
than
the
two
days
preceding
may
17
2001
the
peak
on
5
17
2001
44
923
mw
is
2
78
higher
than
the
peak
on

with
similarly
warm
days
before
5
17
2001
as
there
were
before
5
18
2000
the
peak
would
obviously
have
been
even
higher
this
would
put
the
year
over
year
growth
in
excess
of
3
i
believe
this
falls
right
in
line
with
the
growth
rate
year
over
year
from
an
earlier

in

they

shut

they
have
to
go
on
about
spirit
and
old
army
and
red
ass
and
how
bonfire
represents
the
burning
sensation
they
have
in
their
urine
to
beat
ut
and
blah
blah
blah
shut
up
you
start
to
get
the
feeling
the
entire
school
was
built
to
spite
ut
2
forget
the
fact
that
when
the
texas
legislature
back
in
the
1870
'
s
passed
legislation
to
start
a
state
university
they
also
decided
to
have
a
subsidiary
branch
of
the
main
school
university
of
texas
that
would
teach
agriculture
and
mechanics
aggies
love
to
say
their
school
is
older
from
where
they
get
that
i
don
'
t
now
the
fact
is
the
state
intended
a
m
to
be
a
branch
of
ut
they
are
like
the
afterbirth
fromthe
original
creation
like
danny
devito
in
twins
3
so
they
apparently
have
this
complex
so
much
so
that
they
must
devote
their
entire
school
to
trying
to
prove
to
ut
that
they
are
just
as
good
all
the
while
nobody
at
ut
denies
that
a
m
is
a
good
school
yet
they
won
'
t
shut
up
so
they
write
a
fight
song
about
texas
and
how
they
want
to
beat
them
they
have
a
fish
camp
for
freshman
where
they
tell
them
how
bad
texas
is
and
how
good
a
m
and
all
its
traditions
are
it
is
the
world
'
s
largest
known
case
of
penis
envy
and
it
is
manifested
in
everything
a
m
does
4
the
people
at
a
m
now
we
all
have
friends
who
went
to
a
m
or
are
at
a
m
there
are
some
nice
people
there
however
there
is

to

of
rotc
kids
everywhere
for
every
boy
scout
who
never
learned
to
stop
playing
with
his
gi
joe
toys
there
is
the
corp
now
forget
the
fact
that
a
however
nobody
respects
the
corp
i
imagine
they
are
kind
of
the
laughing
stock
of
the
military
world
just
because
you
dress
like
the
army
and
try
and
act
like
the
army
does
not
make
you
the
army
people
at
a

don
'

even
respect
these

it
is
not

to
shave
your
head
and
dress
up
halloween
is
only
supposed
to
be
one
day
of
the
year
if
you
want
to
carry
guns
and
beat
up
civilians
move
to
israel

it
is
even
less
cool
to
slobber
on
somebody
'
s
daughter
on
national
television
and
call
it
a
tradition
dry
humping
18
year
old
girls
in
the
stands
at
football
games
is
not
cool
not
only
is
it
not
cool
it
should
be
against
the
law
i
know
that
in
college
station
students
are
just
prone
to
mount
each
other
on
the
campus
lawn
or
in
the
middle
of
class
or
anytime
anything
good
happens
you
can
just
grab
the
girl
sitting
next
to
you
and
start
sucking
on
her
face
but
everywhere
else
in
the
world
it
is
looked
down
upon
especially
if
you
are
doing
it
on
my
tv
that
is
why
we
have
moved
the
game
from
thanksgiving
because
people
across
the
nation
were
gagging
on
their
turkey
when
in
the
middle
of
watching
a
football
game
some
boy
scout
is
tongue
thrashing
some
overweight
co
ed
during
somebody
'
s
thanksgiving
dinner
we
do
not
need
to
see
burly
women
engaged
in
a
suckfest
every
time
your
woeful
offense
manages
to
put
points
on
the
board
some
of
these

are
in
desperate
need
of
a

t

is
not

it
is
not

it
is

just
imagine
if
folks
from
texas
kept
talking
about

and
giggling
that
would
not
be
funny
in
fact
it
would
be
retarded
that
'
s
why
ut
fans
don
'
t
do
it
please
learn
7
you
want
to
lose
the
image
of
country
bumpkins
of
a
people
fond
of
sheep
of
people
that
aren
'
t
stupid
then
quit
building
things
that
fall
down
quit
chasing
cheerleaders
around
with
swords
on
national
tv
quit
whooping
in
church
quit
whooping
period
quit
putting
up
scoreboards
for
the
enjoyment
of
dead
mammals
quit
spending
your
friday
nights
practicing
how
to
yell
quit
telling
rape
jokes
to
reporters
when
you
'
re
running
for
governor
when
you
are
filling
out
season
ticket
renewals
and

asks
for
your

h

quit
putting

just
collectively
stop
making
asses
of
yourselves
go
to
east
texas
tour
every
small
town
and
ask
every
red
neck
with
a
5
th
grade
education
why
they
cheer
for
a
m
and
wear
maroon
that
is
your
fan
base
this
is
why
you
are
perceived
by
the
educated
masses
as
stupid
8
nobody
cares
if
you
think
your
band
is
better
they
might
be
louder
they
might
march
in
neat
little
zig
zags
but
they
have
no
musical
ability
the
point
is
nobody
cares
who
wins
halftime
quit
getting
geeked
up
about
marching
bands
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
you
stood
through
your
high
school
band
'
s
entire
halftime
performance
and
why
cause
nobody
cared
then
and
nobody
cares
now
plus
you
can
hear
them
fine
sitting
down
even
if
you
do
care
why
is
it
cool
all
of
a
sudden
now
that
you
'
re
in
college
9
men
should
never
let
out
high
pitched
whooping
sounds
perhaps
the
only
justifiable
situation
in
which
this
can
be
tolerated
is
perhaps
during
an
anal
probe
oh
wait
i
understand
now
10
dogs
are
not
ladies
they
don
'
t
look
or
smell
like
ladies
dogs
eat
their
own
feces
and
should
be
treated
accordingly
11
finally
college
station
is
an
arm
pit
of
a
town
quit
pretending
that
it
is
a
great
college
town
it
is
a
town
and
there
is
a
college
there
that
should
be
the
end
of
this
comparison
if
you
feel
that
life
doesn
'
t
get
any
better
than
the
dixie
chicken
and
enjoy
being
stuck
in
a
never
ending
dukes
of
hazard
episode
then
move
there
more
importantly
don
'
t
move
to
austin
they
are
trying
to
create
an
educated
technological
and
open
minded
population
base
austin
is
and
will
continue
to
be
the
birthplace
and
final
resting

as

my

has

geared
around
finding
what
companies
customers
phone
numbers
and
past
business
that
we
may
have
done
with

we
started
with
and

from
that
starting
point
in
the
few
short
weeks
we
have
addressed
uncovered
and
started
down
the
road
to
what
i
hope
to
be
a
very
profitable
2001
2002
the
crm
database
should
be
a
great
tool
for
those
that
follow
it
appears
that
the
originators
would
log
in
calls
meetings
and
any
other
business
that
gets
discussed
with
the
customer
this
would
have
been
a
great
tool
for
our
group
to
have
had
in
starting
from
ground
zero
there
still
appears
to
be
some
developmental
issues
around
this
program
in
the
meantime
we
are
using
a
number
of
spreadsheets
to
keep
up
with
our

should
the

database
not
be
approved

delayed

this

system

eol

some
of
the
basic
costs
and
timeline
for
this
system
are
120
150
000
for
20
30
users
with
a
5
week
timeline
for
implementation
this
is
a
basic
implementation
that
may
not
include
all
of
the
functionality
shown
above
i
e
no
remote
connectivity
the
reason
that
i
have
written
this
is
to
show
a
possible
system
that
could
be
used
by
the
gas
floor
origination
and
trading
groups
to
manage
contact
information
and
share
data
among
groups
the
cost
to
implement
this
for
all
of
the
origination
groups
does
not
appear
to
be
prohibitive
and
it
could
be
implemented
in
a
good
time
frame
some
of
the
issues
are
coordination
among
the
groups
and
the
desire
to
share
information
let
me
know
if
you
think
this
is
a
viable
possibility
and
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
approach
the
other
origination
groups
colin
tonks
database
system
guy
within
the
fundamentals
group
was
also
at

meeting
and
thinks
this
would
work
great
he

the

you

on
the

required
for
netco
on
the

has
been
consolidated
and
is

i

key

cleburne
issues
daren
with

gone
i
just
wanted
to
touch
base
with
you
on
the
status
of
the
enron
payments
owed
to
the
cleburne
plant
the
current
issues
are
as
follows
november
gas
sales
600
377
50
october
payment
to
ena
for
txu
pipeline
charges
108

november
gas
agency
fees
54
000
00
net
cleburne
receivable
from
enron
654
782
50
per
my
discussions
with
megan
she
stated
that
about
500
k
of
the
600
k
nov
gas
sales
was
intercompany
desk
to
desk
sales
with
the
remainder
from
txu
are
we
able
to
settle
any
intercompany
deals
now
are
we
able
to
settle
with
txu
additionally
you
'
ll
see
that
i
included
the
oct
txu
payment
in
the
receivable
owed
to
cleburne
also
this
is
because
i
always
pay
megan
based
upon
the
pipeline
estimates
in
michael
'
s
file
even
though
they
are
not
finalized
until
the
next
month
therefore
in
my
november
payment
to
enron
i
paid
ena
for
october
'
s
estimate
of
which
megan
would
have
paid
the
final
bill
on
12
26
01
when
it
was
finalized
however
i
had
to
pay
the
october
bill
directly
last
month
even
though
i
had
already
sent
the
funds
to
ena
in
november
therefore
i
essentially
paid
this
bill
twice
once
to
ena
in
nov
once
to
txu
in
dec
i
deducted
the
november
agency
fees
from
these
receivable
totals
to
show
the
net
amount
owed
to
cleburne
please
advise
as
to
the
status
of
these
bills

we

to
talk
about
the
ability

ena
to
continue
its
the
current
role
as
agent
of
tenaska
iv
1
since
the
end
on
november
ena
has
not
been
able
to
complete
gas
trading
transactions
we
cannot
find
any
counterparties
to
trade
physical
gas
in
texas
this
of
course
is
due
to
the
bankruptcy
as
a
result
we
are
not
able
to
sale
tenaska
'
s
excess
fuel
we
did
contact
brazos
to
ask
if
they
would
buy
a
portion
of
the
gas
at
a
gas
daily
price
but
they
do
not
want
it
gas
daily
pricing
has
been
below
the
firm
contract
price
for
a
while
in
december
we
had
to
cut
10

day
from
the
7

through
the
27
th
for
january
we
haven
'
t
had
to
cut
yet

i
am
sure
that
the

will
ask
us
to
do
this
in

tenaska

for

sold
however
due
to
the
bankruptcy
we
could
not
make
payments
out
ena
could
not
pay
the
suppliers
or
the
pipeline
james
armstrong
paid
the
counterparties
directly
i
think
that
he
should
continue
to
do
this
for
dec
and
jan
we
should
not
transfer
any
funds
